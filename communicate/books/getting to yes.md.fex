types:
    unnecessary conflicts:
        different interests but same goals
        different interests but non-conflicting goals
        simply avoid
        reduce by not sharing irrelevant opinions
        reduce by not being too honest / clear about interests
    smoldering conflicts:
        out of desire to not embarass others / preserve harmony
        but conflicting goals & interests
        initiate as only gets worse
    active conflicts:
        open disagreements of goals & interests
        initiate as only gets worse

about arguments:
    thinking in right or wrong not helpful in conflicts
    "winning" arguments:
        two opposing opinions means one is wrong
        hence opponents lecture or judge the other
        little time for logical reasoning 
        as must come up with next argument to "destroy" the opponent
    decompose arguments:
        each contains facts, self revelations, relationships and call to actions
        facts and relationship are often mixed 
        leading to discussions about the facts but problem is relationship

imbalance of impression:
    cause of action:
        seems reasonable within the context
        but are judged without context and credited to character
    way of reasoning:
        seems assertive, communicative
        like being careful or strong in an argument
        but may seem ruthless, talkative
        like a coward, or a know-it-all
    judgment:
        focus on specific aspects
        but conclusions may differ as different aspects observed
    change proposals:
        seem cautious and reasonable
        but may radically interpreted until clearly negative

principles of communication:
    separate knowledge from interpretation:
        differentiate what you know and what you concluded  
        be aware of the unknown unknowns
    clearly communicate expectations:
        define deliverables & their relative importance
        define responsibilities and how deviations are handled
        invest time to clarify these points (as later more costly)

constructive feedback:
    give positive feedback whenever appropriate, be aware that positive behaviours are harder to detect
    choose quiet/relaxes location & time frame to be able to focus
    let the receiver prepare internally by asking multiple times ("i would like to give feedback to ...", "is now a good time")
    give:
        be respectful
        describe specific behaviours
        do not evaluate, instead describe how it affects oneself ("I have a problem with this because ...")
        propose alternative and justify the interests
        do not evaluate or focus on character
    take:
        be relaxed and thankful
        actively listen (let other finish speaking, be curious & ask for clarifications if needed)
        do not defend, justify
        reflect & draw conclusions / change behaviours
    non-violent communication:
        observe facts ("i see there are used socks on the floor")
        note feelings ("this makes me uncomfortable")
        uncover desires ("i want order in the house")
        make explicit requests ("would you be willing to put these away?")

mirror/interview conversations:
    others most likely to change if arrived at conclusion by themselves
    can guide by "interviewing" them  
    needs high attention, sensitivity and fast thinking.
    guidelines:
        ask neutral question
        summarize continuously the brought up points without assessing them
        confirm that the summary is complete and accurate
        proceed with the next questions

address unspoken conflicts:
    check for signs of suppressed aggressions or otherwise unhealthy behaviours
    avoid to interpret & assess, instead only describe what you see/feel
    tools:
        observations ("I can see that you frizzy your forehead") without interpretation ("you are annoyed")
        subjective interpretation ("it seems to me that you are not convinced")
        questions about the view of the other ("what do you think about the proposal")

resolve conflict:
    the "discover mode":
        always assume good intentions
        investigate point of view of the other
        show interest, respect, try to understand perspective
        summarize understood points and ask for confirmation  
        then ask to summarize own point of view
    formulations to avoid:
        accusations ("you")
        claiming objectivity ("it is obvious")
        usage of micro-aggressions ("unrealistic")
        usage of generalizations ("always", "never")
        demanding/prohibiting ("you can not seriously think ...").
    constructively disagree:
        clearly show what follows are own points of view
        formulate interests, expectations and opinions
        like "I see this differently", "I assume our customers ...", "I am angry").
        then call to action ("lets find out", "what is your point of view").
    stop attacks:
        do not ignore (because attacker may continue)
        do not defend (because may escalate)
        acknowledge the attack (but only as little as needed to stop them)
        shift focus back on subject
    deescalate:
        calm down internally (sit down, breath deeply)
        observe and describe current situation/communication pattern 
        like "we are annoying each other because ..."
        appeal to noble cause of each participant
        like "we are all here because we ..."
        then propose to focus on interests & targets 
        like "how can we reach our target of..."
    interest based discussion:
        preserve face as interests do not change
        only positions need to
