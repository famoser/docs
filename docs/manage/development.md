# Development

## Estimation

**weighted shortest job first**:  
cost of delay (sum of business value, risk reduction, opportunity enabler) / duration  
because absolute esimates are hard, rank the items and then assign relative cost

## Tipps

WIP limit helps to detect & resolve bottlenecks    
trunk based development allows large teams to avoid merging hell  
central test data management so e2e tests have single resource to call
