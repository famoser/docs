the essence of "self-help" books

## Covey

1. be proactive; work towards gaining influence even to the parts you can not yet influence
2. begin with the end in mind; plan what you want to archive, and constantly assess if you are on the right track
3. order by importance & impact; work on long-term investments instead of short-term achievements of little value
4. think win-win; work towards long-term stable solutions
5. first understand, then try to be understood; listen empathetically, understand the other opinions and the environment they were developed in, then explain
6. work sustainable; exercise, take breaks and be a part of society
