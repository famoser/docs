# Personal Development

the essence of "self-help" books

## Covey

1. be proactive; work towards gaining influence even to the parts you can not yet influence
2. begin with the end in mind; plan what you want to archive, and constantly assess if you are on the right track
3. order by importance & impact; work on long-term investments instead of short-term achievements of little value
4. think win-win; work towards long-term stable solutions
5. first understand, then try to be understood; listen empathetically, understand the other opinions and the environment they were developed in, then explain
6. work sustainable; exercise, take breaks and be a part of society

## feedback received

### works well

- transfer of expert knowledge
- formation of team (the "we" focus)
- efficiency of meetings
- pragmatic decision taking

### room for improvements

- communicate the why of deadlines -> replace by prioritization & speed?
- reminders uncomfortable -> different formulation of reminders, better deadline communication, automate remainders by impersonal tool?
- testing of work other team members depend on -> easier e2e testing setup
- documentation of decisions -> define & use appropriate place
