# thinking fast and slow

## two systems

system 1 for intuition, automatic decisions  
little effort, but little control  
system 2 for logical thinking, complex decisions  
high accuracy, but high effort  

## major fallacies

priming (nudging, associations influence decisions)  
cognitive ease (easy wins; like old ideas, clear presentation)  
easy even wins when the falsehood has been proven to be false  
jumping to conclusions ("what you see is all there is", confirmation bias)  
answering easier questions (simplify, sometimes too much, questions)  
law of small numbers (believe in conclusions drawn from too small samples)  
anchors (clinging to some, any!, number to compare to)  
availability (recent / vivid experience skews decision)  
more strongly with impulsive, intuition guided people  
wrong statistics (miscalculating bayesian probabilities)  
regression to mean (mistakenly looking for casual explanation for out-of-norm)  
illusion of understanding (causality looked for where none exist)  
illusion of validity (experts overjudge their expertise)  
planning fallacy (too optimistic planning, no consideration for unknown unknowns)  
entrepreneurial delusion (ignorance of competition)  

## prospect theory

valuation judged differently depending on anchors  
like 10mio different for rich & poor person  
probabilities judged wrongly  
like small judged too high  
loss aversion (risk averse for unsure loss, risk seeking for sure loss)  
the contrary for gains
