# crucial conversations

## start with heart

interests based discussion
keep reflecting if own behaviour still represents interests

avoid fools choice:

- winning vs loosing, peace vs honesty
- combine wants and not-wants to get true interest to pursue

## learn to look

content & conditions and discussion matters
lost safety motivates defensive mechanisms
watch behaviour / body language for perceived lost safety

silence
- masking (hiding true opinion)
- avoiding (only superficial talks)
- withdrawing (exit talks)

violence
- controlling (coercing others)
- like overstating facts, speaking in absolutes, directive questions, ...
- labelling (dismiss using stereotype ideas/persons)
- attacking (belittling & threatening)

## make it safe

ensure mutual purpose (entrance condition)
believable honest motives & interest in others' goals, values
and mutual respect (continuance condition)
believable respect based on similarities & mutual interests
as soon as one of the two lost must recover
before continuing with conversation

apologize
- when respect was violated
- sincere / without face-saving apology
- recognise causing / not preventing harm

contrast
- when misunderstandings
- not an apology, but an explanation of intentions
- address concerns that purpose was malicious
- "i dont want to disrespect / bad purpose"
- declare what the target was/is
- "i do want to show appreciation; I will do this later"

create mutual purpose
- when no misunderstandings but different interests collide
- (c)ommit to stay in discussion until solution is found
- (r)ecognise purpose (what the real interest is)
- (i)nvent mutual purpose (focus on stronger / higher goals)
- (b)rainstorm new strategies (invent options for mutual benefit)
