weaker position 
- want to feel safe & in control

listen intensively, show empathy and sincere desire to understand
repeat last 3 words / main points to signal understanding

validate emotions by acknowledging it
"it seems like, it sounds like, it looks like", ...

upon no:
- what about this does not work for you
- what do you need to make it work

trigger no's so other feels in control:
- is now a bad time to talk
- have you given up on the project

safety:
- stop me at any time you feel it is unfair

manipulation:
- extreme anchor given

use loss aversion
make sure something to lose if deal not striken

price:
- communicate unreasonable anchor
- let other suggest first (might be higher than what was hoped for)
- compare with similar deals in high range
- add non-monetary things
- use precise calculated (eg non-round) numbers

price range:
- 65% -> 85% -> 95% -> 100%
- add non-monetary offer at limit

accusation audit:
- "You are going to be insulted by my offer"
- "I am embarrassed to tell you my offer"
- "You are going to think I have not done my homework"

leverage:
- positive (something they want)
- negative (can make them suffer; loss aversion makes this more powerful)
- normative (where other partie's values conflict)

prepare:
- who is their audience
- what signifies status / reputation
- what most worries them
- what are their (personal) dreams

calibrated questions:
passive-aggressive questions so other party feels in control
- what makes you ask
- what about the deal is important to you
- how can I make this better for us
- how would you like me to proceed
- how can we solve the problem
- how am i supposed to do that
- how will we know we are on track
- how do we address things if we find we are off track

use own name:
- what is the florian's discount?

rejection:
	thank you for taking the time to talk to me. 
	how am i supposed to do that

	that is very generous / more than fair. 
	im sorry that just does not work for me

deflect anchor:
- answer with own unreasonable anchor
- restart from principles ("what are we trying to accomplish")
- non-monetary ("what else can you offer to make this a good deal")

reflect:
- choice of words
- choice of clothes
- beliefs & ideas

reason for crazy:
- ill-informed
- constrained
- hidden interests

observe:
- observe ungarded moments (before / after meetings, interruptions, ...)

negotiation one-sheet:
- set optimistic but realistic goal, discuss with others & write it down
- summarize known facts that lead up to the negotation
- perform accusation audit (labels like "it seems like ... is valuable to you")
- calibrated questions to reveal interests & overcome deal killers (counterpart, team, environment)
- do not forget non-cash offers
