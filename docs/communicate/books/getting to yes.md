# getting to yes

## types

unnecessary conflicts

- different interests but same goals  
- different interests but non-conflicting goals  
- simply avoid  
- reduce by not sharing irrelevant opinions  
- reduce by not being too honest / clear about interests  

smoldering conflicts

- out of desire to not embarass others / preserve harmony  
- but conflicting goals & interests  
- initiate as only gets worse  

active conflicts

- open disagreements of goals & interests  
- initiate as only gets worse  

## about arguments

thinking in right or wrong not helpful in conflicts  

"winning" arguments

- two opposing opinions means one is wrong  
- hence opponents lecture or judge the other  
- little time for logical reasoning  
- as must come up with next argument to "destroy" the opponent  

decompose arguments

- each contains facts, self revelations, relationships and call to actions  
- facts and relationship are often mixed  
- leading to discussions about the facts but problem is relationship  

## imbalance of impression

cause of action

- seems reasonable within the context  
- but are judged without context and credited to character  

way of reasoning

- seems assertive, communicative  
- like being careful or strong in an argument  
- but may seem ruthless, talkative  
- like a coward, or a know-it-all  

judgment

- focus on specific aspects  
- but conclusions may differ as different aspects observed  

change proposals

- seem cautious and reasonable  
- but may radically interpreted until clearly negative  

## principles of communication

separate knowledge from interpretation

- differentiate what you know and what you concluded  
- be aware of the unknown unknowns  

clearly communicate expectations

- define deliverables & their relative importance  
- define responsibilities and how deviations are handled  
- invest time to clarify these points (as later more costly)  

## constructive feedback

give positive feedback whenever appropriate, be aware that positive behaviours are harder to detect  
choose quiet/relaxes location & time frame to be able to focus  
let the receiver prepare internally by asking multiple times ("i would like to give feedback to ...", "is now a good time")  

give

- be respectful  
- describe specific behaviours  
- do not evaluate, instead describe how it affects oneself ("I have a problem with this because ...")  
- propose alternative and justify the interests  
- do not evaluate or focus on character  

take

- be relaxed and thankful  
- actively listen (let other finish speaking, be curious & ask for clarifications if needed)  
- do not defend, justify  
- reflect & draw conclusions / change behaviours  

non-violent communication

- observe facts ("i see there are used socks on the floor")  
- note feelings ("this makes me uncomfortable")  
- uncover desires ("i want order in the house")  
- make explicit requests ("would you be willing to put these away?")  

## mirror/interview conversations

others most likely to change if arrived at conclusion by themselves  
can guide by "interviewing" them  
needs high attention, sensitivity and fast thinking.  

guidelines

- ask neutral question  
- summarize continuously the brought up points without assessing them  
- confirm that the summary is complete and accurate  
- proceed with the next questions  

## address unspoken conflicts

check for signs of suppressed aggressions or otherwise unhealthy behaviours  
avoid to interpret & assess, instead only describe what you see/feel  

tools

- observations ("I can see that you frizzy your forehead") without interpretation ("you are annoyed")  
- subjective interpretation ("it seems to me that you are not convinced")  
- questions about the view of the other ("what do you think about the proposal")  

## resolve conflict

the "discover mode"

- always assume good intentions  
- investigate point of view of the other  
- show interest, respect, try to understand perspective  
- summarize understood points and ask for confirmation  
- then ask to summarize own point of view  

formulations to avoid

- accusations ("you")  
- claiming objectivity ("it is obvious")  
- usage of micro-aggressions ("unrealistic")  
- usage of generalizations ("always", "never")  
- demanding/prohibiting ("you can not seriously think ...").  

constructively disagree

- clearly show what follows are own points of view  
- formulate interests, expectations and opinions  
- like "I see this differently", "I assume our customers ...", "I am angry").  
- then call to action ("lets find out", "what is your point of view").  

stop attacks

- do not ignore (because attacker may continue)  
- do not defend (because may escalate)  
- acknowledge the attack (but only as little as needed to stop them)  
- shift focus back on subject  

deescalate

- calm down internally (sit down, breath deeply)  
- observe and describe current situation/communication pattern  
- like "we are annoying each other because ..."  
- appeal to noble cause of each participant  
- like "we are all here because we ..."  
- then propose to focus on interests & targets  
- like "how can we reach our target of..."  

interest based discussion

- preserve face as interests do not change  
- only positions need to
