# Explain software

## Construction analogy

- skyscraper needs different approach than simple shed
- to rebuild a house with a different architecture is expensive
- to move a wall to another place is expense because of labour, not materials
- prebuilt components like dishwashers are bought or expensively reinvented
- planing and building can be done in stages (like foundation and interior details)
- changes to a load bearing wall are much more expensive than to a simple room divider
- if a skyscraper is build, some precautions / safety margins have to be made to reduce risk

## software development process

explain using logic (big project = needs planning)
analogy (construction site) or
data (10 times less expensive if failures detected early; studies by IBM & HP)

to start a software project you need a clear vision about what problem will be solved.
this helps the team to align, enables "common sense" and generates a multitude of solution.

work in iteration that are as small as possible while still providing some business benefit.
the reduced complexity speeds up exponentially and the focus can shift much quicker.
reduce iteration size with high risk, complex applications, inexperienced team and changing circumstances 

### iteration

define specific, verifiable goals to get close to the vision.
analyze the risks with the goals to archive.
define the required quality of user interaction, design and architecture (experimental, MVP, market-ready?).
gather first use cases and analyze how to introduce, maintain and sunset the tool.

work out high level specification with wireframes to align how these goals should be reached.
structure the project to reduce the risks early.
choose concrete approaches to reach the required quality.
sketch deployment pipeline, organize support and continuous maintenance.

estimate the time needed to implement and the requirements and align with availabilities.
adjust the development practices according to the scale of the project.

scale utilities:
- code reviews
- clear responsibilities
- architecture planning
- design reviews
- more rigid requirements
- formal change control
- requirement reviews
- deployment procedure
- test planning
- different QA team
