# feedback

## works well

- transfer of expert knowledge
- formation of team (the "we" focus)
- efficiency of meetings
- pragmatic decision taking

## room for improvements

- the why of deadlines -> replace by prioritization & speed?
- reminders uncomfortable -> different formulation of reminders, better deadline communication, automate remainders by impersonal tool?
- unresolved dependencies -> easier e2e testing setup
- decisions undocumented -> define & use appropriate place

## further research

- Conflict Dynamic Profile
- Aggression Questionnaire (Buss & Perry)
