# Negotation

Use principled negotiation:

- separate the people and the problem
- concentrate on interests not positions
- develop different decision options and compare with BATNA
- use objective decision criteria (maintain relationships, satisfy both sides)

## Black rhetorics

interrupt (ask for clarifications, to repeat or closed/open questions, "could you repeat ...").  
embarrass (ask difficult questions, quickly answer it with facts to leave the impression the asked one does not know those, "you do not even know the basics").  
play naive (project the image of trying to understand but pretend that it is impossible to do so, "I am still struggling with...").  
object continuously (always object, "I just want to look at the problem from a different point of view").  
indirect insult (use formulations to accuse, "you misunterstand me").  
direct insults (based on profession/education/lifestyle, wrap it up in a joke).  
deny competence (too young/old, no real-world experience; "its not personal").  
deny integrity (pick out inconsistent behaviour, "you have arrived by airplane").  
focus on irrelevant details (to avoid talk about the point in question).  
appeal to morals (use rhetorical questions, "you dishonour the legacy ...").
mimic to focus on the big picture ("lets focus on the main points, I can deliver the detailed numbers ...").  
mimic diligence (disregard arguments that are imprecise, "this just seems not properly thought through").  
phrases ("it is obvious", "everyone with good common sense").  
conjunctive (to get the opponent to say something stupid, "what would you do if ...").  
counter questions (directly ask another question to get control of the conversation, "i can answer this question but what will you do with the response?").
