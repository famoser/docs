# Negotiation

principled negotiation:

- separate the people from the problem (work towards mutual agreement, actively listen and interpret in their favours
- focus on interests not positions (stand in their shoes to find out why / why not)
- invent options for mutual gain (do not finish negotiation until both parties have been heard
- insist on using objective criteria (find out intentions and never give in to pressure)
- work on your BATNA (but do not let it hinder you to find the best possible outcome)
