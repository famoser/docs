# Decisions

effectively take decisions

You may not know yet the decision you need to take; work them out in a [meeting](meetings.md).

## Poll

for small, fully understood problems

Let the majority win.

Potentially save the acceptance rate in the form of coloured dots, to be able to come back to it later if necessary.

## Discourse

for complex problems, small groups

Let the best argument win.

Hand out problem beforehand, and allow members to work out arguments. Let neutral present the arguments to disconnect them from the person.

## Consensus

for unimportant problems, small groups

Talk until consensus is reached, potentially reaching a win-win.

If you need to negotiate, use the Harward method:

- separate the people and the problem
- concentrate on interests not positions
- develop different decision options and compare with BATNA
- use objective decision criteria (maintain relationships, satisfy both sides)

## Consent

for complex problems

Refine solution until no more arguments against it can be brought up.

You may structure the process like this:

- Present proposition
- Answer questions
- Gather reactions from everybody
- Potentially refine proposition
- Ask everybody for any counter arguments; if found, refine again; else accept the proposition

## Veto

for complex decision, weak leadership

Let team to take decisions fully, but use veto if something goes "wrong".

## Systematic consent

for unimportant problems, small groups

Choose solution which provokes the littlest resistance / negative feelings.

## Consultative Decision

for complex problems, big groups

Choose someone to investigate and then take an informed decision.

You may structure the process like this:

- Choose decision taker (choose the closest person to the problem as possible)
- Choose consultation partner (choose experts and those impacted most)
- Decision taker with the consultation partners
- Decision taker chooses the best solution
  - taking full responsibility
  - taking into account the advice from all the consultation partners
  - ensuring its in the companies best interest
- Decision taker communicates
  - the basis for the decision
  - the decision itself
  - why certain consultation partners were skipped
  - why certain advice was overruled
- In exchange, the decision taker receives
  - full support from all consultation partners for the decision
  - feedback
