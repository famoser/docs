## Covey

1. be proactive; work towards gaining influence even to the parts you can not yet influence
2. begin with the end in mind; plan what you want to archive, and constantly assess if you are on the right track
3. order by importance & impact; work on long-term investments instead of short-term achievements of little value
4. think win-win; work towards long-term stable solutions
5. first understand, then try to be understood; listen empathetically, understand the other opinions and the environment they were developed in, then explain
6. work sustainable; exercise, take breaks and be a part of society

## not giving a f

focus on values, not targets.  
choose explicitly what to care for, and ignore noise.  
problems will always exist, but can be chosen depending on relationships / career path.  
love the problems & the process, not (only) the final result.  
take responsibility for own problems (no matter how they are caused).  
uncertainty is normal and allows to improve.  
avoid protecting some identity as it prevents change.  
"do something": always do something, even if small.  
relationships need trust.
