# Communicate

Use most direct form of communication available.  
Especially if many questions open, try to arrange a call instead.

## E-Mails

same as clean code applies: a single, minimal purpose. structure cleanly without repetitions.

content:

- introduce by responding to previous email /events or introduce self (if first email).
- write short answer (actionable advice / help) which potentially resolves conversation.
- future steps / easy call to action

mirror:

- choose the same form of anrede/gruss like your conversation partner.
- adapt the tone / formality to your conversation partner.
- respond at similar times / at least working times.

respond within 24 hours or ensure the conversation partner receives a notice when a response can be expected.  
get back to people if no response received in 72h.

## Presentations

adapt length & depth to the audience.
ensure the moment is right (if in doubt, ask).

make it look stunning.
send drafts to target audience to involve them in specification.
