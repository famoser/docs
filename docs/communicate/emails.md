# Emails

if many questions open, try to arrange a call instead.

## content

same as clean code applies: a single, minimal purpose. structure cleanly without repetitions.

separate multiple paragraphs:
- introduce by responding to previous email /events or introduce self (if first email).
- write short answer (actionable advice / help) which potentially resolved conversation.
- motivate / explain why answer works or makes sense.
- future steps

choose the same form of anrede/gruss like your conversation partner.

adapt the tone / formality to your conversation parter.

## communication pattern

during working days, respond within 24h.
if this is not be possible, ensure the conversation partner receives a notice when to expect a response.

send emails at appropriate (working) times.
get back to people if no response received in 72h.
