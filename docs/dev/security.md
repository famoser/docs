## Forensic incident node taking

structure notes into People, Places, Things and Events to make it transparent what happened

All notes include `information source`, `created at` and `created by`. For persons, you may include names, phone numbers and occupation. For the others, simply include a description.

Do not adjust an existing note; create the new information same as a new note, then mark the old note as deprecated. Take physical notes if you do need them to be evidence or if you are in an untrusted environment. Take digital notes to ease collaboration and for more efficient workflows.
