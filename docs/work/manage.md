# Project management

## project management

aspects:

- complexity exponential
- APIs complex
- getting it done
- bugs after launch
- maintenance is 10-20%
- complexity / estimation technology independent

plan:

- vision (what to do; priorities)
- elements (what needed to solve)
- cost/complexity, benefit/reward, risk
- calculate priority
- order
- milestones
- risk analysis
- risk mitigation

during project:

- continuously overview risks
- manage cost
- manage expectations

environment:

- ownership product -> outside
- vision, expertise, schedule -> team
- progress, relationships -> stakeholders

big vs small releases:

- incremental updates & releases help to adapt rapidly (saving time with shortcuts, skipping unneeded functionality, improving through early feedback)
- big bang is more efficient with no unknown unknowns (the longer the project, the smaller the chance)
