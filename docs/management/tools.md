notes to devops:  
WIP limit to ensure bottlenecks are resolved, people help each other
trunk based dev for large team to avoid merging hell
central test data management so e2e tests have single resource to call

weighted shortest job first:  
cost of delay (sum of business value, risk reduction, opportunity enabler) / duration
because absolute esimates are hard, rank the items and then assign relative cost
