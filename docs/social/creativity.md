tools to be creative

## Lateral Thinking

concerned with possibilities, what might be; tries to be different to normal, duductionable conclusions by deduction

### Techniques
Use a creative pause; meaning simply stop for some time trying to come up with something new.

Change the focus to a different aspect of the problem. 
You can choose a purposed focus "make room cleaner", but be careful how it is phrased as it probably contains prejudgments.
Alternatively you can choose a general area type focus "improve my room", and then only pursue ideas that go into the defined boundaries.

You can create a creative challenge, by asking why something is done that way. 
Once you have found some answers, you can create a creative challenge by either blocking ("the maschine no longer exists"), escaping ("we do not need the result anymore at all") or dropping ("we can satify the need differently")

Look for alternatives, even when there is none needed at the moment. 
Create alternatives by fixing purpose, resemblance (lookalikes), group (type of thing) or concept ("reward for work"). 

Takle a bigger concept than the one in question at the moment; by asking "how does it help" (homeoffice -> reduce traffic). 
Go into the other direction by asking "how can we implement this" (refude traffic -> different work schedules).

Abstract a concret process/product into its concepts (like fast food -> cheap, standardized, fast). 
You may encounter concepts that are purpose based (like umbrella -> protection from the rain), mechanism based (like umbrella -> roof) and value based (like umbrella -> convenient).
Then improve on these concepts, potentially strenghten them, implement or combine them differently.

Provocate with proposing unusual/absurd solutions. Work out these solutions by chaning the focus to an unusual perspective.
