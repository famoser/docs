## self-organizing CDE (Hackmann / Hundermark)

describes basics to allow a self-organized team to flourish

to allow self-organisation, there needs to be:

- Container (clear boundary between member or not member of team)
- Differences (clear differences between the members in education, experience, culture, ...)
- Exchange (communication within and without the container)

the team is part of the environment, which should provide the team with:

- Information (sufficient information about the business/sales/analytics)
- Infrastructure (sufficient hard/software, rooms, ...)
- Education (allow the team to educate self)
- Reward (exposure & money)

the manager is in charge to optimize the environment that the required properties can be achieved, and that team work is possible. Possible actions:

- Container: change members, rooms, seating
- Differences: change members, provocative questions, ensure all voices heard, change decision procedures
- Exchanges: train members to solve conflicts, create cosy environments, change meeting concept/frequency, change communication channels
