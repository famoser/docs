# Teams

how people working together interact

## Trust Pyramid (Stuart Wells)

defines and describes stages of teams and how they can succeed.

*Contractual* as the lowest level of trust. Team members refer to job title, contractual arrangements and other rules of law. Communication is primary in the written form and escalated frequently. The team can function if everyone aligns to the contract.

*Conditional* which allows verbal agreements. Team members use phrases like "If you do that, I will to this*. Communication is primarily written but also verbal. The team functions if everyone cooperates fairly.

*Cooperative* when trust is established. Team members are passionate about the project, discuss disagreements openly and distribute work load according to skill level and personal needs. The team functions if everyone receives a fair share of the reward.

*Un-Conditional* when total trust is established. Team members know their and the others' value and place in the team and respect it. Members will cover for other to preserve the reputation of the team. The teams success comes first.

## Performance Pyramid

describes attributes of functional / failing teams ordered by degree of escalation

*good* teams show trust, conflict readiness, commitment, shared responsibility and finally goal-orientation.  
*failing* teams display lack of openness, lack of harmony (gossip), ambiguity, low standards and finally dominance of status/ego.

## Self-organized teams (Ross Ashby / Heylighten)

describes how self-organization is characterized

a real team has the following features;

- a compelling mission to fulfil
- clear boundaries (information flow, alignment to organisation, resources, decision power)
- authority to self-manage (within those boundaries)
- stability over some period of time

the following aspects have to be managed (either by the team or manager)

- directions (target/purpose of the team)
- designing the performing unit (environment, scheduling, work behaviour, ...)
- monitoring/managing work progress
- execution of the work

self-organized teams are characterized by:

- distributed control
- continuous adaptation
- emergent structures
- positive/negative feedback
- resilience
