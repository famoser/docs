# conflicts

avoid unnecessary conflicts, initiate smoldering conflicts & resolve active conflicts.

too many conflicts with the motivation to be clear & honest about opinions
smoldering conflicts becauses want to avoid to embarass others & harmony

## aspects of active conflicts

two opposing opinions means one is wrong; hence opponents lecture or judge the other.  
little time for logical reasoning because must come up with the next argument to destroy the opponent..

each message contains elements of facts, self revelation, relationship and call to action.
facts and relationship are often mixed leading to discussions about the facts when there is a problem with the relationship.

truth seekers think in right or wrong; not helpful in conflicts

## imbalance of impression
own cause of actions seems reasonable within the context
but are judged by the other without the context and credited to the character.

own way of reasoning seems assertive, communicative; like being careful or strong in an argument;   
but to the other may seem ruthless, talktive; like a coward,or a know-it-all

own conclusion of some event may focus on specific aspects
but the others conclusion may differ because different aspects were observed

own change proposals may seem cautious and reasonable
but the others interpret the proposal more radical until it is clearly negative

## principles of communication

**separate knowledge from interpretation**  
differentiate what you know and what you concluded.  
be aware of the unknown unknowns.

**clearly communicate expectations**  
define deliverables & their relative importance, responsibilities and how deviations are handled.  
invest time to clarify these points as good as possible; later on it will cost more.

## the "discover mode"

assume the other has good intentions

investigate the point of view of the other ("what is you point of view").  
show interest and respect and try to view the problem from the other's perspective.  
summarize the understood points and ask for confirmation.  
then ask to summarize own point of view.  

## formulations

avoid formulations which accuse ("you"), claim objectivity, use micro-agressions ("unrealistic") or generalizations ("always", "never") and demand/prohibit ("you can not seriously think ...")

formulate while clearly showing these are own points of view, interests, expectations and opinions ("I see this differently", "I assume our customers ...", "I am angry"). Follow with a call to action ("lets find out", "what is your point of view").

## constructive feedback

give positive feedback whenever appropriate, be aware that positive behaviours are harder to detect.  
choose quiet/relaxes location & time frame to be able to focus.  
let the receiver prepare internally by asking multiple times ("i would like to give feedback to ...", "is now a good time").  

**give**:
- be respectful
- desribe specific behaviours
- do not evaluate, instead describe how it affects oneself ("I have a problem with this because ...")
- propose alternative and justify the interests
- do not evaluate or focus on character

**take**:
- be relaxed and thankful
- actively listen (let other finish speaking, be curious & ask for clarifications if needed)
- do not defend, justify
- reflect & draw conclusions / change behaviours

## mirror/interview conversations

for others to be most likely to change they need to arrive at the conclusions for themselves.  guide them where they want to be themselves by "interviewing" them.  
be highly attentive, sensitive and smart; 

guidelines:
- ask neutral questions
- summarize continuously the brought up points without assessing them
- check with the other the summary is complete and accurate then proceed with the next questions

## address unspoken conflicts

check for signs of suppressed aggressions or otherwise unhealthy behaviours.
avoid to interpret & assess, instead only describe what you see/feel.

tools:
- observations ("I can see that you frizzy your forehead") without interpretation ("you are annoyed")
- subjective interpretation ("it seems to me that you are not convinced")
- questions about the view of the other ("what do you think about the proposal")

## stop attacks

do not ignore (because attacker may continue) or defend (because may escalate).  
instead acknowlege the attack (as little as possible to stop them)  
and shift focus back on subject.  


## deescalate conflicts

calm down internally (sit down, breath deeply).  
observe and describe current situation/communication pattern.  
then propose an alternative approach focusing on interests & targets.

> "we are annoying each other by talking about ...; 
> lets discuss how we can reach the target of ... in general"

appeal to the noble cause of each participant

change to an interest based discussion to preserve face (interests do not need to change, only positions do!)

### black rhetoric

interrupt (ask for clarifications, to repeat or closed/open questions, "could you repeat ...")  
embarrass (ask difficult questions, quickly answer it with facts to leave the impression the asked one does not know those, "you do not even know the basics")  
play naive (project the image of trying to understand but like it is impossible to do so, "I am still strugging with...")  
object continuously (always object, "I just want to look at the problem from a different point of view")  
indirect insult (use formulations to accuse, "you misunterstand me")  
direct insults (based on profession/education/lifestyle, wrap it up in a joke)  
deny competence (too young/old, no real-world experience; "its not personal")  
deny integrity (pick out inconsistent behaviour, "you have arrived by airplane")  
focus on irrelevant details (to avoid talk about the point in question)  
appeal to morals (use thetorical questions, "you dishoner the legacy ...")
mimic to focus on the big picture ("lets focus on the main points, I can deliver the detailed numbers ...")  
mimic diligence (disregard arguments that are too imprecise, "this just seems not properly thought through")  
phrases ("it is obvious", "everyone with good common sense")  
conjunctive (to get the opponent to say something stupid, "what would you do if ...")  
counter questions (directly ask another question to get control of the conversation, "i can answer this question but what will you do with it?")

### principled negotiation

seperate the people from the problem (work towards mutual agreement, actively listen and interpret in their favot)  
focus on interests not positions (stand in their shoes to find out why / why not)  
invent options for mutual gain (do not finish negotiation until both parties have been heard  
insist on using objective criteria (find out intentions and never give in to pressure)  
work on your BATNA (but do not let it hinder you to find the best possible outcome)
