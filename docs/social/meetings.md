### Walt-Disney method

to explore ideas.

judge from different perspectives:

- the *Dreamer* as a visionary who produces ideas
- the *Realist* as a maker who tries to implement the ideas
- the *Critic* as a quality manager which asks critical questions
- the *Neutral* as a neutral which enables the discussion

### 6 Thinking Hats

to explore ideas.

judge from directions:

- *Manager* (blue) which has the big picture, defines the subject and goals
- *Informer* (white) collects information and provides facts
- *Emotional* (red) produces gut feelings without justifications
- *Discernment* (black) analyses practically and realistically
- *Optimistic response* (yellow) looks at the bright side.
- *Creativity* (green) provokes and thinks outside the box

Using these hats, one can construct programs: A sequence of time-boxed discussions where a specific hat is chosen for each interval. This helps the group focus on aspects of the problem and avoids chaotic discussions.

One may choose a sequence best suited for the problem under discussion: For example, in the conceptual phase of a project one, may choose the following sequence: `Blue` (to define what has to be answered), `White` (to share knowledge of team members), `Green` (to collect ideas) and then `Blue` (to elect an idea to focus on next).
