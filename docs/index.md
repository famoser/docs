# Welcome to Docs

This is a collection of things I find/found notable.

I might summarize books or structure my own experiences; mostly I do both at the same time. I may note down things I do not agree with, and leave out obvious part I already apply. 

Please do not conclude about how I work or think from the content contained in here.
