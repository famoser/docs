This is a collection of things I find/found notable. 

The notes are free from personal opinion and judgement; each note simply summarizes the most important points as described by the source. Consequently, personal experiences and other "meta-knowledge" are considered off-topic. Hence, to really make use of the note, one must do some additional reserach.

A summary is finished if:

- A reader can decide sensibly if the note is relevant.
- All aspects which should be known by heart are included.
- The formulation is both clear and minimal. 
- Further research can be started easily.
