This is a collection of things I find/found notable.

I may create notes while reading about a topic I am new to (psychology, philosophy, ...). To be able to remember / process the new information, I summarize the most important points **as described by the source**. Consequently, personal experiences and other "meta-knowledge" are off-topic.

I may create notes while reading about something I am familiar with (programming, project management, ...). I note down things I find well summarized or I want to embrace more in the future. I leave out information that is obvious to me ("name variables sensibly") because this is not useful to me.
